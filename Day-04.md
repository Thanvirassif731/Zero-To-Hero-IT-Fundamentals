## 1. Types of Operating Systems

| Type            | Description                       | Examples                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Desktop OS**  | For personal computers            | Windows, macOS, Ubuntu          |
| **Server OS**   | For managing networks and data    | Windows Server, Red Hat, CentOS |
| **Mobile OS**   | Designed for mobile devices       | Android, iOS                    |
| **Embedded OS** | Inside devices like ATMs, routers | RTOS, Embedded Linux            |

**Analogy**: Different cars need different engines. Same with devices‚Äîthey need OS based on their job.

## 2. Functions of an Operating System

The OS is like the **manager or traffic controller** of the computer.

### Key Functions:

* **Manages hardware resources** (CPU, RAM, storage)
* **Runs applications**
* **Provides user interface (GUI or CLI)**
* **Handles files and permissions**
* **Ensures system security and stability**

<br>

## 3. Building an OS (Basic Concept)

Operating Systems are built using:

* **Low-level languages** (C, Assembly)
* **Kernel**: The core that talks to hardware
* **Drivers**: Help OS communicate with specific devices
* **User interface**: GUI (graphical) or CLI (text-based)

> We don‚Äôt build one from scratch here‚Äîbut understanding it helps you **appreciate how complex and powerful an OS is**.

<br>

## 4. CLI vs. GUI Operating Systems

| Feature        | CLI (Command Line)         | GUI (Graphical User Interface) |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Interface      | Text-based                 | Mouse and icons                |
| Learning Curve | Steeper                    | Easier for beginners           |
| Speed          | Faster for experts         | Slower but easier              |
| Examples       | Linux Terminal, PowerShell | Windows, Ubuntu Desktop        |

Tip: **Both are important**‚Äîas an IT professional, you'll use **CLI for power tasks** and **GUI for ease**.

## 5. Computer Boot Process (Simplified)

The journey from **power on ‚ûù desktop ready**:

1. **Power On**
2. **BIOS/UEFI runs** ‚Üí Basic hardware check
3. **Bootloader starts** ‚Üí Loads OS from disk
4. **Operating System boots up**
5. **Login screen appears**

> Analogy: Like waking up, stretching, finding your shoes, and then walking out the door!

<br>

## 6. OS File System Management

The OS organizes how data is stored.

* **File System**: Structure for managing files
* Common types:

  * **Windows** ‚Üí NTFS, FAT32
  * **Linux** ‚Üí EXT4, XFS
* Organizes:

  * Files
  * Folders/Directories
  * Permissions
  * Disk partitions

Tip: You‚Äôll learn file systems deeply when you manage Windows/Linux OS in future sections.
