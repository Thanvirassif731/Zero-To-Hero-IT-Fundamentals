## 1. Introduction to Storage

> Storage = A place to **save and access data**.

All the files, software, and OS are stored in **some kind of storage device**, like a **Hard Disk, SSD, USB, or Cloud**.

üß† Analogy: Storage is like your **bookshelf** ‚Äî you can organize and retrieve info when needed.

<br>

## 2. How Storage is Measured

| Unit   | Full Form    | Size                   |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1 Bit  | Binary Digit | Smallest unit (0 or 1) |
| 1 Byte | 8 Bits       | A character            |
| 1 KB   | Kilobyte     | 1024 Bytes             |
| 1 MB   | Megabyte     | 1024 KB                |
| 1 GB   | Gigabyte     | 1024 MB                |
| 1 TB   | Terabyte     | 1024 GB                |
| 1 PB   | Petabyte     | 1024 TB                |

**Example:**

* A Word file = \~50 KB
* A song = \~5 MB
* A movie = \~1‚Äì2 GB

<br>

## 3. Types of Computer Storage

| Storage Type  | Example              | Volatile? |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| **Primary**   | RAM                  | Yes       |
| **Secondary** | HDD, SSD             | No        |
| **Tertiary**  | Tape drives (backup) | No        |
| **Offline**   | USB, CD/DVD          | No        |

<br>

## 4. RAM vs. SWAP vs. Virtual Memory vs. Cache

| Term               | Function                 | Location                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **RAM**            | Temporary working memory | Physical hardware          |
| **SWAP**           | Fake RAM on hard disk    | Disk                       |
| **Virtual Memory** | Combined RAM + SWAP      | Disk + RAM                 |
| **Cache**          | Super-fast small memory  | CPU (L1, L2) or disk cache |

üß† Analogy:

* **RAM** = Your desk
* **SWAP** = Drawer under the desk
* **Cache** = Sticky notes on your screen
* **Storage** = Bookshelf

<br>

## 5. Hard Disk Drive vs. Solid-State Drive

| Feature    | HDD                 | SSD                         |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Speed      | Slower (Mechanical) | Very fast (No moving parts) |
| Durability | Less durable        | More durable                |
| Noise      | Makes sound         | Silent                      |
| Cost       | Cheaper             | Costlier                    |

**Tip:** Most modern laptops use SSDs. Servers may use SSDs + HDD combo.

<br>

## 6. RAID ‚Äì Redundant Array of Independent Disks

RAID is a **method to combine multiple disks** for better performance or reliability.

| RAID Level | Use Case       | Description                             |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| RAID 0     | Speed          | Data split across disks (No redundancy) |
| RAID 1     | Safety         | Mirrors data (Backup)                   |
| RAID 5     | Balance        | Striping + Parity (Needs 3+ disks)      |
| RAID 10    | Speed + Safety | Combination of RAID 1 + RAID 0          |

<br>

## 7. Hardware RAID vs. Software RAID

| Type              | Managed by           | Performance |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| **Hardware RAID** | RAID controller card | Better      |
| **Software RAID** | OS handles it        | Cheaper     |

üß† In production servers, **hardware RAID** is preferred.

<br>
