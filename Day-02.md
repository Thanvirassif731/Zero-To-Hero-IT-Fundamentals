# üß± Day 02 ‚Äì Computer Components
We'll cover 8 key areas:

1. Hardware

2. Software / Operating System

3. Application Software

4. Networking

5. Database

6. Storage

7. Virtualization & Cloud

8. Security

<br>

## 1. What is Hardware?
Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that you can touch.

<b>Examples:</b>

- Monitor, keyboard, mouse

- CPU, RAM, hard drive, motherboard

<b>Analogy:</b> If a computer were a human body:

- Hardware = Body parts (hands, brain, eyes)

<br>

## 2. What is Software / Operating System?
Software is a set of instructions that tells hardware what to do.

The Operating System (OS) is the core software that manages the whole computer.

<b>Analogy:</b> OS is like the manager of a company that assigns tasks and keeps everything running.

<b>Examples of OS:</b>

- Windows

- macOS

- Linux

- Android (mobile)

<br>

## 3. Application Software
These are programs you install for specific tasks.

<b>Examples:</b>

- Microsoft Word (typing)

- Google Chrome (browsing)

- Zoom (video calls)

<b>Analogy:</b> If OS is the manager, then application software is the employees doing specific jobs.

<br>

## 4. Networking
Networking connects computers together to share data.

Without networks, there would be no internet, no email, no YouTube!

<b>Analogy:</b> Networking is like a road system that allows cars (data) to travel between cities (computers).

<br>

## 5. Database
A database is a collection of organized information (data).

Used in banking, apps, websites, etc.

<b>Analogy:</b> A database is like a digital filing cabinet.

<br>

## 6. Storage
Refers to where and how data is saved permanently or temporarily.

<b>Types include:</b>

- Hard drives (HDD)

- Solid-state drives (SSD)

- Cloud storage

<b>Analogy:</b> Storage is like your bookshelf or memory box ‚Äì it keeps your stuff safe even when the power is off.

<br>

## 7. Virtualization and Cloud
Virtualization: Creating virtual (not physical) versions of computers.

Cloud: Storing and accessing data over the internet instead of your own device.

<b>Analogy:</b>

- Virtualization = Running multiple ‚Äúmini-computers‚Äù inside one computer

- Cloud = Renting space in a giant online computer warehouse

<br>

## 8. Security
Protects computers, networks, and data from damage or unauthorized access.

<b>Includes:</b>

- Antivirus

- Firewalls

- Passwords and encryption

<b>Analogy:</b> Security is like the locks, alarms, and guards of a computer system.
