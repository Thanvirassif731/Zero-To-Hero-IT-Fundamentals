##  4. Computer Language (0 and 1 Concept)
Computers donâ€™t understand English! They only understand binary - 0s and 1s.

<b>Example:</b>

- Letter 'A' in Binary: ```` 01000001 ````

- These 0s and 1s represent electricity (off = 0, on = 1).

<b>Analogy:</b> Like how Morse Code uses dots and dashes, binary code uses 0s and 1s.
