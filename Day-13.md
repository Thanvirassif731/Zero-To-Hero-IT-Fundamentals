## 1. Why Troubleshooting Matters

> ‚ÄúTroubleshooting is not just fixing things ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **systematic process** of identifying and solving problems.‚Äù

**You‚Äôll use it in:**

* Desktop support
* Cloud management
* Security issues
* System errors
* Network downtimes

<br>

## 2. Follow Policies & Standards

**Always follow:**

* **Company policies** (e.g., no hard resets without approval)
* **Security standards** (don‚Äôt bypass firewalls or passwords)
* **Change management** (log changes to avoid blame later)

<br>

## 3. Documentation & Ticketing

| System                      | Purpose                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| JIRA, ServiceNow, Freshdesk | Used for raising tickets |
| Notion, Confluence          | Notes/documentation      |
| GitHub Issues               | Developer bug tracking   |

**Always document:**

* Problem description
* Steps you took
* Final resolution

<br>

## 4. Patience & User Communication

* Listen actively
* Avoid tech jargon when talking to non-tech users
* Ask clear questions:

  * ‚ÄúWhen did this happen?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat exactly did you click on?‚Äù

üßò Take a breath. Calm approach = faster fix.

<br>

## 5. Use Online Help

* **Google & Stack Overflow**
* Official docs (Microsoft, Ubuntu, etc.)
* YouTube tutorials
* Forums (Reddit, Spiceworks, etc.)
* ChatGPT üòÑ

üí° Pro Tip: Don‚Äôt copy-paste. Understand the **"why"**.

<br>

## 6. Understand Before Acting

Before restarting or uninstalling, ask:

* What caused this?
* What changed recently?
* Did it work before?

Start with small changes and **test after each**.

<br>

## 7. Trace Logs for Clues

| Tool                             | Use                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `Event Viewer` (Windows)         | System errors         |
| `journalctl`, `/var/log` (Linux) | Service issues        |
| `cloudwatch logs` (AWS)          | Cloud troubleshooting |
| Browser dev tools                | Web errors            |

Look for timestamps, error codes, or service failures.

<br>

## 8. Involve Vendors When Needed

* Contact support (Microsoft, AWS, Dell, etc.)
* Keep logs/screenshots ready
* Know your **warranty** or **support level**

<br>

## 9. Don‚Äôt Give Up!

Real IT pros don‚Äôt always know the answer ‚Äî they know **how to figure it out**.

> ‚ÄúEvery bug you fix, even if small, is one more step to mastery.‚Äù
