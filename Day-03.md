##   1. Types of Computers

| Type                | Description                              | Examples                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Desktop**         | Large, fixed computers                   | Office PC, Home setups    |
| **Laptop**          | Portable computer                        | Dell XPS, MacBook         |
| **Tablet**          | Touch-based compact devices              | iPad, Samsung Tab         |
| **Server**          | Powerful machines for hosting apps/data  | Web servers, file servers |
| **Smartphone**      | Mini computers in your pocket            | iPhone, Android phones    |
| **Embedded System** | Special-purpose computer inside a device | Microwave, Smartwatch     |

##   2. RAM and Installing RAM

* **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary memory that helps run applications fast.
* More RAM = Smoother multitasking.
* Installed on the motherboard as small sticks.

**Analogy**: RAM is like a **desk** ‚Äì the bigger it is, the more tasks you can handle at once.

<br>

##   3. CPU, Cores, and Sockets

* **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** = Brain of the computer.
* **Cores** = Small units inside the CPU that handle tasks. More cores = better multitasking.
* **Socket** = Physical slot on motherboard where CPU fits.

**Analogy**: CPU is the **thinker** of your PC; cores are its **hands** working simultaneously.

<br>

##  4. Installing a CPU

Installing a CPU involves:

1. Matching the CPU to the correct motherboard socket.
2. Inserting it gently.
3. Applying thermal paste.
4. Locking it with a fan (heat sink).

*We‚Äôll walk through a simulated version later in YouTube videos.*

##   5. 32-bit vs. 64-bit Processing

* **32-bit OS/CPU**: Can use up to 4 GB RAM.
* **64-bit OS/CPU**: Can handle much more RAM and performance.
* Most modern systems = 64-bit.

<br>

##  6. Hard Disk Drives (HDD)

* Permanent storage for files, apps, and OS.
* HDD: Traditional, cheaper, slower.
* SSD (Solid-State Drive): Faster and more durable.

**Analogy**: HDD is like a **bookshelf** storing everything.

##  7. Motherboard

* Main circuit board connecting all components: CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, etc.
* Acts like a **central highway**.

<br>

##   8. Internal Components

| Component        | Role                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Fan**          | Cools down hardware                 |
| **Power Supply** | Converts electricity to usable form |
| **CD-ROM**       | (Rare now) Reads CDs/DVDs           |

<br>

##  9. External Components

| Component | Use                         |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Monitor   | Displays visual output      |
| Keyboard  | Text and command input      |
| Mouse     | Point and click interaction |
| Printer   | Produces hard copies        |
| Speakers  | Audio output                |

<br>

##  10. Hardware Manufacturers

Some well-known brands:

* **CPU**: Intel, AMD
* **RAM**: Corsair, Kingston
* **Motherboard**: ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, LogiTech
* **Storage**: Seagate, WD, Samsung
* **Laptops**: Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple

## 11. Human Body vs. Computer Comparison

| Human Body    | Computer Equivalent     |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Brain         | CPU                     |
| Eyes          | Monitor                 |
| Hands/Fingers | Mouse & Keyboard        |
| Skeleton      | Motherboard/Frame       |
| Stomach       | Hard Drive              |
| Blood Vessels | Cables/Wires            |
| Heart         | Power Supply Unit (PSU) |
