<br>

## 1. How Computers Communicate

Computers talk using **network protocols**.
They send and receive **data packets** across cables, Wi-Fi, or the internet.

**Analogy**: Think of computers like people speaking different languages. Protocols make sure everyone understands each other.

<br>

## 2. IP Address (Static vs. DHCP)

#### IP Address = Identity of a device in a network

Like a house address, used to send/receive data.

| Type               | Description                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Static IP**      | Manually set; doesn't change       |
| **DHCP (Dynamic)** | Automatically assigned by a router |

Example: Your home printer might use a **static IP**, while your phone uses **DHCP**.

<br>

## 3. TCP/IP ‚Äì Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

> This is the core language of the internet.

* **TCP** ‚Äì Breaks data into packets, ensures delivery
* **IP** ‚Äì Delivers each packet to the right address

<br>

## 4. Gateway

A **gateway** connects your local network to the **outside world** (like the internet).
Usually, your **home router** is the gateway.

<br>

## 5. Subnet Mask

Used to divide a network into **sub-networks** (subnets).

Think of it like separating departments in a company ‚Äî each subnet is a group of computers that can communicate internally.

<br>

## 6. MAC Address

> MAC = Media Access Control

* Unique **hardware address** of a device‚Äôs network card
* Example: `F0:4D:A2:1C:3E:90`
* Doesn‚Äôt change, unlike IP

**Analogy:** MAC is like your **fingerprint**, IP is like your **home address**.

<br>

## 7. OSI Model (7 Layers)

A theoretical model showing **how data flows** from one device to another.

| Layer            | Description             | Example    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| 7 - Application  | End-user interface      | Browser    |
| 6 - Presentation | Data formatting         | Encryption |
| 5 - Session      | Start/stop sessions     | Logins     |
| 4 - Transport    | Break/rebuild data      | TCP/UDP    |
| 3 - Network      | IP address & routing    | IP         |
| 2 - Data Link    | MAC address & switching | Ethernet   |
| 1 - Physical     | Cables, Wi-Fi           | Hardware   |

**Mnemonic**: **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing

<br>

## 8. OSI vs. TCP/IP

| Feature         | OSI Model                                   | TCP/IP Model                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Layers          | 7                                           | 4                             |
| Use             | Theoretical                                 | Practical, used in real world |
| Layers Combined | Yes (e.g., App + Pres + Sess = Application) | Yes                           |

<br>

## 9. Protocols and Ports

Protocols = Rules for communication
Ports = Virtual doors for traffic

| Protocol | Port | Use                         |
| -------- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| HTTP     | 80   | Web (insecure)              |
| HTTPS    | 443  | Secure web                  |
| FTP      | 21   | File transfer               |
| SSH      | 22   | Secure shell (remote login) |
| DNS      | 53   | Name to IP lookup           |
| SMTP     | 25   | Email sending               |

>Tip: You‚Äôll use ports **a lot** when working with servers and firewalls.

<br>

## 10. Network Devices

| Device           | Function                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Hub**          | Broadcasts data to all (old tech)               |
| **Switch**       | Smarter, sends data only to the intended device |
| **Router**       | Connects networks (home to internet)            |
| **Modem**        | Connects to ISP (Internet Service Provider)     |
| **Access Point** | Extends Wi-Fi range                             |

<br>

## 11. How the Internet Works (Simplified)

1. You type `www.google.com`
2. Your computer asks DNS to find its IP
3. Browser connects to Google‚Äôs server using IP
4. Google sends data back via routers & networks
5. Page appears in your browser!

**Analogy:** Like writing a letter ‚Üí post office ‚Üí mailbox ‚Üí delivery.
